RCKit
=====
RCKit (React Kit) provides a personal starter point for developing front end projects using
react. I consistently keep forgetting how to do so alot, so this is me being lazy, yet
wise. 

## Usage

Simply clone this repository into your own directory and delete the `.git` directory.
Ensure to update the `package.json` to match your project name, repository and other details

```bash
> mkdir sample-project
> cd sample-project
> git clone https://github.com/gokit/rckit.git .
> rm .git
```
